This project project includes a search system for Web and iOS platforms. It will 
help users find each other.
During the second half of the past century, especially the last two decades, thanks to the 
economic crisis, there were many cases in maternity hospitals, when parents were told that their 
newborn children had died during the labour. Those children were sold to childless families 
later. As a result today we hear about a lot of cases, when families look for their lost member or 
some people themselves try to find their real families and relatives. Those were the reasons why 
a facebook group called “Vedzeb” was created ( fb.com/groups/vedzebgroup ). The group has 
more than 131 000 members and it is very active and growing constantly (during the last four 
months the number of members has grown by 40 000, the group has 10 or more new posts every 
day). These facts emphasize the severity of the problem. At the same time, there is no system, in 
which people can add advertisements, use more sophisticated search tools, than facebook group 
can offer and find lost relatives more effectively and easily.
Our goal was to create a convenient and user friendly system, which will make it easy for 
seekers to reach their goals. The application looks and works like other platforms, in which it’s 
possible to add advertisements. The app connects two sides - applicant and seeker. The filters are 
customized according to our problem and it’s possible to filter out useful information using only 
a few actions. If there is a match, the seeker can contact the author of the advertisement. Also 
we have got a blog space, where the users can read about the results reached using our platform. 
Users can manage their advertisements, profile or add a new advertisement using the user 
cabinet, but advertisements and blog space is available for non authorized users too.
